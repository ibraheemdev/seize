    /// # Performance
    ///
    /// Creating and destroying a guard is about the same as locking and
    /// unlocking an uncontended `Mutex`, performance-wise. Because of this,
    /// guards should be re-used across multiple operations if possible.
    /// However, note that holding a guard prevents the reclamation of any
    /// concurrent objects retired during it's lifetime, so there is a
    /// tradeoff between performance and memory usage.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// # use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicPtr, Ordering};
    /// # let collector = seize::Collector::new();
    /// use seize::{reclaim, Linked, Guard};
    ///
    /// let ptr = AtomicPtr::new(collector.link_boxed(1_usize));
    ///
    /// let guard = collector.enter();
    /// let value = guard.protect(&ptr, Ordering::Acquire);
    /// unsafe { assert_eq!(**value, 1) }
    /// # unsafe { guard.defer_retire(value, reclaim::boxed::<Linked<usize>>) };
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Note that `enter` is reentrant, and it is legal to create
    /// multiple guards on the same thread. The thread will stay
    /// marked as active until the last guard is dropped:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// # use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicPtr, Ordering};
    /// # let collector = seize::Collector::new();
    /// use seize::{reclaim, Linked, Guard};
    ///
    /// let ptr = AtomicPtr::new(collector.link_boxed(1_usize));
